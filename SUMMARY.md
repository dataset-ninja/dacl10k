**dacl10k: Benchmark for Semantic Bridge Damage Segmentation** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 9920 images with 62327 labeled objects belonging to 19 different classes including *rust*, *spalling*, *weathering*, and other: *crack*, *efflorescence*, *protective equipment*, *cavity*, *hollowareas*, *drainage*, *wetspot*, *graffiti*, *joint tape*, *exposed rebars*, *restformwork*, *bearing*, *expansion joint*, *alligator crack*, *rockpocket*, and *washouts/concrete corrosion*.

Images in the dacl10k dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 2081 (21% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (6935 images), *test* (2010 images), and *val* (975 images). Additionally, every label has one of following tags: ***damage class*** or ***object class***, also test dataset has ***testdev*** or ***testchallenge*** image tags. The dataset was released in 2023 by the University of the Bundeswehr Munich.
